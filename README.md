# ud036_StarterCode

This is a project that was built in order to open a web page that plays the trailers of my favorite movies. 

This project contains three *.py* files:

1. ### media.py

   This file contains a Movie class that I created for the project.

2. ### entertainment_center.py

   This file contains instances of the Movie class, a list of these instances, and the function call that opens the website.

3. ### fresh_tomatoes.py

   This file contains the starter code that udacity provided and the function that is called to open the website: 
   `def open_movies_page(movies):`
   Run this program to see the website.
